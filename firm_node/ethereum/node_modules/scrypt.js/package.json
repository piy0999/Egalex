  "readme": "# scrypt.js\n\nThis purpose of this library is to provide a single interface to both a C and a pure Javascript based scrypt implementation.\nSupports browserify and will select the best option when running under Node or in the browser.\n\nIt is using the following two underlying implementations:\n- [scryptsy](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/scryptsy) for the pure Javascript implementation\n- [scrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt) for the C version\n\nIt only supports hashing. Doesn't offer an async option and doesn't implement the HMAC format. If you are looking for those,\nplease use the Node `scrypt` library.\n\n## API\n\nThere is only one method returned for hashing using scrypt. All parameters are mandatory except the progress callback:\n- `key` - The key/passphrase. Although it accepts a String, please use a Buffer to avoid problems later.\n- `salt` - The salt. Same as with the `key`, please try to use a Buffer.\n- `n` - Iteration count.\n- `r` - Block size for the underlying hash.\n- `p` - Parallelization factor.\n- `dklen` - The derived key length aka. output size.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```js\n// Load default implementation\nvar scrypt = require('scrypt.js')\n\n// Load specific version\nvar scrypt = require('scrypt.js/js') // pure Javascript\nvar scrypt = require('scrypt.js/node') // C on Node\n\nscrypt(key, salt, n, r, p, dklen, progressCb) // returns Buffer\n```\n\n### The progress callback\n\nThis callback (`progressCb` in the above example) is not available on Node.\n\nEvery 1000 iterations it will return an object with the following properties:\n- `current` - Current iteration number.\n- `total` - Total iterations.\n- `percent` - Progress in percentage (double).\n\n## Other scrypt implementations\n\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt: Uses the C implementation (version 1.2.0), both async and async.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt-hash: Uses the C implementation and offers only an async option.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/scryptsy: A pure Javacript implementation. Offers a progress callback.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt256-hash: Another C implementation. Doesn't seem to be maintained.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrypt-jane-hash: Uses an alternative C implementation (called scrypt-jane). Doesn't seem to be maintained.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-scrypt-em: Emscripten-compiled scrypt 1.1.6. Doesn't seem to be maintained.\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-scrypt: Wraps `js-scrypt-em` and offers sync and async options. Doesn't seem to be maintained.\n",
